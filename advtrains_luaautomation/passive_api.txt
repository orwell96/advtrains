Lua Automation - Passive Component API

Passive components are nodes that do not have code running in them. However, active components can query these and request actions from them. Examples:
Switches
Signals
Displays
Mesecon Transmitter

All passive components have a table called 'luaautomation' in their node definition and have the group 'save_in_nodedb' set, so they work in unloaded chunks.
Example for a switch:
luaautomation = {
	getstate = function(pos, node)
		return "st"
	end,
	-- OR
	getstate = "st",

	setstate = function(pos, node, newstate)
		if newstate=="cr" then
			advtrains.ndb.swap_node(pos, <corresponding switch alt>)
		end
	end
}
