### Advtrains Privilege Guide
All privileges are automatically granted to singleplayer, but for
multiplayer servers this might be interesting.
There are 3 groups of privileges introduced by advtrains:

## Trains
For a player to build his own trains and driving them, the player needs
the 'train_operator' privilege. This privilege no longer allows him to
control any train, only the ones that he owns or that he is whitelisted on.
The owner of a wagon can write a whitelist which players are allowed to
operate his wagon using the wagon properties dialog.
Players having the 'train_admin' privilege can always drive, build and
destroy any train.

## Tracks*
The area 1 node around and 4 nodes up from each track node is protected.
Players that don't have the 'track_builder' privilege can not build or
dig (or modify) anything inside this area.
If any player tries to modify anything that is in the area of a track
node and this track node is protected from him, he also can not do this.
(that said, while checking protection, the area around a track is
treated as the track node itself)

## Turnouts and Signals*
Players without the 'railway_operator' privilege can not operate signals
and turnouts.

* If the configuration option 'advtrains_allow_build_to_owner' is set,
an exception applies to players missing the required privileges when
they are in a protected area that they have access to. Whether the
area is protected from others is checked by checking for protection
against a dummy player called '*dummy*'
